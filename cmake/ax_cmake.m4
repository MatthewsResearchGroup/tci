# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CMAKE_OPTION(feature, help-string)
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro adds an option of the type --{enable,disable}-<feature>
#   using AC_ARG_ENABLE. If either option is specified, this information is passed
#   on to CMake as -DENABLE_<FEATURE>={ON,OFF}, respectively. If no option
#   is passed to configure, then no flag is passed to CMake either, and the default
#   value as specific in CMakeLists.txt will be used.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CMAKE([extra-args], [env])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro runs CMake, passing through any user-specific options
#   or enable flags (see AX_CMAKE_OPTION and AX_CMAKE_ENABLE), as well
#   as selected compilers via CC and CXX arguments, and finally any
#   install path options such as --prefix. Additional arguments extra-args
#   may also be passed to CMake, and environment variables env are defined
#   for the invocation.
#
#   The ConfigureWrapper package should be included in CMakeLists.txt
#   to emulate the full range of GNU install paths in case the configure
#   front-end is not used.
